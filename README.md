Short-term visitors to the Schengen countries that do not need visa are permitted to spend up to 90 day during 180 day period on territory of the Schengen Area. This calculator will be able to calculate number of days which left for future travels on base of days which user spend already in Schengen Area countries. Passed all trips will be showed in clear way for user with duration and number of days which are still available. Also in plans we have to show all data and statistics with easily readable charts.

For admins there is available an admin page with possibility of adding and deleting new countries and granting admin role to other users.
